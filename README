Behavior:
If it is plugged in, the light will stay solid (charging).  If a notification comes in with the screen off, it will blink green.  If you turn on the screen, the charging light will come on.  If you don't acknowledge the notification, when the screen turns off it will blink green again.

When it is not plugged in, notifications will blink green only when the screen is off.
